## Overview
The program allows for 2 players to compete against each other in a game of Tic Tac Toe. It allows users to interact through HTTPS requests, where API server provides endpoints for various actions related to setting up and playing the game. Upon starting the server, a new game is initialized with each player being given their corresponding symbol (either "X" or "O"). Players can then make moves by specifying the position where they want to place their symbol. The goal of the game is to occupy 3 squares in a row, either hotizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


## How To Run
### Cloning Instructions
1. Install git on the device where you wish to access the repository.
2. Clone the necessary files using one of the following methods:
>To clone using HTTPS, copy the link under “<> Code” in the upper right-hand side of the page.
>
>To clone using an SSH key, copy the SSH link under the same tab.
3. Once the link is copied, open git bash, or your respective terminal where git has been installed, and change into the directory where you wish to store the repository.
4. Type git clone, paste your copied link and press Enter.
5. If the repository is being cloned using HTTPS Authentication, enter your credentials when prompted. If using SSH Authentication, enter your unique SSH key when prompted.
6. Once the repository is cloned to your directory, open the program using your preferred IDE.
7. When the program is loaded, confirm a GlassFish Server configuration has been added before running.
8. Once a configuration has been established, run the server, to have the game open in your default (or otherwise specified) browser.
9. You may now play Tic Tac Toe!
